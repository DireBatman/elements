		<description>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything offers a host of new options for DUNGEONS and DRAGONS, and our journey through those options is accompanied by the notes of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell Tasha's hideous laughter, Tasha's life is one of the most storied in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches herself, Tasha adventured across the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers, like Mordenkainen. In time, she ruled as the Witch Queen and later changed her name to lggwilv-a figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, and admired. </description>
